Airbnb is an online marketplace for arranging or offering lodging, primarily homestays, or tourism experiences. The company does not own any of the real estate listings, nor does it host events; it acts as a broker, receiving commissions from each booking.The company is based in San Francisco, California, United States.
In this project use Tableau tool for the better understanding how things is working and just for the much more better understanding I would like to do exploratory data analysis, for that I used Colab tool.
